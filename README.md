SALES DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALISATION 
This project analyzes a sales dataset to uncover insights such as total sales per year, highest-selling products by category, most frequently used shipping modes, and more. The analysis is performed using Python, and the results are visualized using libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal of this project is to analyze a sales dataset and answer key business questions, such as:
What are the total sales per year?
Which product category and sub-category have the highest sales?
What is the most frequently used shipping mode?
Which state has the highest sales?
Which customer segment generates the most revenue?
The analysis is performed using Python, and the results are visualized using interactive and static charts.

DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset contains the following columns:
order_date: Date of the order (e.g., 2015-01-01).
ship_mode: Shipping mode used (e.g., First Class, Same Day, Standard Class).

Most Frequently Used Shipping Mode:
Determined the most commonly used shipping mode.
State with the Highest Sales:
Found the state that generated the most revenue.
Segment with the Highest Sales:
